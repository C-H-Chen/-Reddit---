If so, 14 is still quite far from 22. It's too small of a sample size to really worry/care, but it's an early look that MIGHT indicate to much of a swing towards the offense.

Of course, implementing this in a more pitcher-friendly league (ideally in conjunction with the Atlantic League, to compare) would give a better look at whether it's a problem and if that's exacerbated by the environment of the league or something that's going to majorly change the offense in any league it's implemented.",2021-08-06 14:28:58,3

It’s not going to make contact hitting more valuable, and makes hitting for power easier. 

It’s not like offense is a problem rn. With foreign substance enforcement, offense has surged back up to fairly high levels. Runs per game is higher than 2018 currently. The change does nothing to address climbing walk and strikeout rates, which is where the perceived problem lies. Foreign substances were reasonably going to improve that. Moving or lowering the mound does nothing, and has not been shown in any way to do anything relevant to the issue at hand, which is walk and strikeout rates (perceived inaction, which is mostly walks imo), not overall offense.",2021-08-06 14:28:58,-1

It was people actually looking at the data and realizing people just don't hit the ball on ground to their opposite side very often, at all.  


DJ LeMahieu spray charts from 2019 to now are telling. He is a push hitter on most things in the air but if you look at ground balls it's all either at the 2nd base hole (where the 1 infielder plays on a shift), first base, or all over the left side. Just, everywhere.  He gets shifted on. 

Jeter had very similar hit patterns. He'd be shifted on today. 

Altuve is getting shifted on now and there have been people saying he should be shifted on since at least 2018. Article comes up on a quick Google. 


It turns out basically no one has enough bat control to pick where they want to send the ball at the major league level consistently.  On the ground in particular. Controlled tomohawking a MLB pitch is nigh impossible. Everyone learned how to hit in certain ways and thats how they hit.    

*Especially* with modern pitchers being aware of that and pitching into the shift.  They aren't going to put 5 fielders on one side and then give you a pitch outside to slap that way - and much much more often than not when someone *does* go the opposite way, they get lift on it so the infielders don't matter. 


Think about all the opposite field singles you've seen and I bet the vast majority are either line drives over the infield or bloops that do the same.",2021-08-06 14:28:58,7

I thought the shift came about because when hitters started trying to constantly pull the ball for power, if they didn't get lift it sent the ball on the ground to their pull side anyways. Wouldn't that be the shift coming into prominence due to the change in approach towards pull-side power?

They're not coincidental. The rapid adoption of aggressive shifting is what caused and even more rapid change in philosophy across the league to sell out for power. The saying is that it's easier to hit it over the shift than against the shift).

h4mk24g,[Pacheco] Automated Strike Zone in the Atlantic League is working wonderfully,baseball,raistlin212,"I also realize that being an ump is a VERY tough job.  It's not like the next guy up would be better if they dropped the lowest performing ump back to the minors every week.  If the best hitters in the world can barely keep up with increasing spin rates, a 50 year old ump isn't going to be doing that much better.  A bottom tier pitcher in the MLB right now gets as much or more movement on a pitch than the best pitchers did 40 years ago.  The number of people who throw 99+ MPH is at an all time high, and there are multiple teams with people that that have that kind of speed AND that movement at the same time.  It's a different game, the training pitchers have now is barely being matched by the best hitters and it blows all but the top 10-15 umps in literally the whole world away.

Umps lose the benefit of the doubt when they put on an Ump Show because they have a short hook or want to be the center of attention or put up a game like we had last night.  But I quickly acknowledge that it's not entirely their fault that they blow 1 call in 20.

h4n8yrc,[Pacheco] Automated Strike Zone in the Atlantic League is working wonderfully,baseball,Slobbin,"That's not what they are talking about. 

The rules work like this in real life: 

The strike zone is a 3D object. It goes from the knees to the armpits officially, IIRC, for height, and the entire surface of the plate is used. If it crosses the plate while simultaneously being in that vertical zone, it is a strike. 

What does it mean by crossing the plate? 

If, at any time during the balls flight path, you were to cut a sliver at it's widest point (directly in the middle, horizontally), put that cut out piece directly down on the ground, and it touches the plate, it has crossed the plate. 

In MLB The Show 21, it does not (at least, it appears not to) work like that. A pitch is called a strike if half or more of the ball crosses the plate.",2021-07-09 08:09:10,5

h4n8br1,[Pacheco] Automated Strike Zone in the Atlantic League is working wonderfully,baseball,Slobbin,"And even that's not perfect. There is no singular camera angle that can tell you whether a ball was a strike or not, you have to combine two different camera angles - one directly from the side and one directly above - and even THOSE will have small room for error. 

You'd need cameras to follow DIRECTLY above the ball and DIRECTLY on the side. A camera that matched the height of the ball as it moved would provide a perfect horizontal angle, and a camera that matched the horizontal movement from above would provide a perfect vertical angle. 

Then you would need to combine those two to determine where exactly the pitch was at any given time. You would be able to see how far off the ground was AND exactly where over the plate (or not) the ball went.

Whether it’s right or not that they’re trained to do that, is a separate issue. You’ll notice it’s rarely the umps getting animated with people though, unless they need to say something.

Then you need two sets of cameras (left and right side) where you have three cameras at like 1000 or maybe closer to 10,000 FPS to catch the ball when it’s over the plate, then triangulate the ball in all those frames and compute it’s position for each frame where it’s over the plate until you get one where you can call a strike. Worse you often have a white ball crossing a white batter’s uniform. So if you can do that great. I’m sure nVidia lives your business (and can I have one of your rigs?) 

Another option is predictive, not did the ball go over the plate but do we think it did based on a couple of measurements we did. You’re gonna have problems with stuff that breaks late and hard and fuck any knuckleballers, bless their hearts. You still need a few cameras but you take less frames and fill in the gaps between them with curves. I’m not sure that’s an easier problem to get right though I can imagine what the math might look like. Any flaws though and you’ll see pitchers drive a train through it. 

I think TV gave us the impression it’s easy but they don’t have to actually get it right and we aren’t in a position to measure it’s accuracy. 

Gods speed to them, it’s be nice if they can do it well though I prefer the human element, as long as the zone is consistent, convex and not rediculously large or small. I bet we could improve it fast if they started firing umps who weren’t good.",2019-11-04 12:57:19,34
f6iwfpq,Automated Strike Zone Whiffs At Arizona Fall League,baseball,PatientGiraffe,"Technically, it is not that hard of a problem to solve.  Image processing and recognition is really, really good.  

You need at least 3 cameras, one overhead, and one at each side facing the batters boxes.  Slow motion capture on all 3.  You will use 2 each pitch depending on the side the batter hits from.  Coordinate the pitch through the strike zone of the batter.  Capturing pitch location and trajectory is relatively easy.

The hard part is having the computer measure the subjective.  Where exactly is the top and bottom of the zone for a batter.  Do you use infrared to get to their exact body parts, or a visual camera?  If its visual, what if they wear a baggy shirt, does that mean their top of the zone is lower than it should be?  This is the part that will not be easy and algorithms and rules will need to be written and tweaked to get it right.

I know one poster mentioned that the strike zone will end up being a lot bigger and I think they are right.  Especially for pitchers that pitch at a wide angle with side arm or 3/4s deliveries.  Their pitches will clip tiny bits of the plate due to angles a lot and they will get more strikes called than maybe they do now.",2019-11-04 12:57:19,10

f6ji0dd,Automated Strike Zone Whiffs At Arizona Fall League,baseball,NotCamNewton,"> The hard part is having the computer measure the subjective. Where exactly is the top and bottom of the zone for a batter.

I feel like the only true way to make it work is to measure literally every player to determine where their strike zone is on the vertical axis, and use those measurements in conjunction with the vertical 3D plane used by TrackMan to figure out what a strike would be. So let's say Judge's zone is measured and defined as starting at 20 up from the plate (example number", I have no idea how high his knees really are lol) and goes up to 59 above the plate (figuring another 20 below the top of his head). That data is then used to determine if a ball was thrown across the zone within that range and determine a strike or ball from there, and Judge couldn't argue it because those are his official measurements.

With that said I have no idea how the system being used in the AFL actually operates. I'm assuming a TrackMan sensor is placed below the plate and detects the ball crossing the plate using a vertical radar signal, similar to how it works for their golf products. If that's not how it's utilized then my suggestion may not be applicable.,2019-11-04 12:57:19,3

Without that, then I agree you have to measure the batter, or have a human set the top/bottom levels or have the machine do its best guess.

And it's really not a question of if it will happen, it will.  Throwing a breaking/sinking pitch that just crosses the strike zone before hitting the dirt is something a lot of pitchers can do today, but it doesn't happen a lot because they assume unless the batter swings it's not getting called a strike, so they won't try it outside of a good pitchers count.  Change that assumption on the pitchers part to where they not just assume but *know* if they throw it right it will be called a strike and everyone who can throw it will.  And they will have great success because it's going to be very difficult to put that ball in play.  So other pitchers will learn to throw it as well.  And kids will see it and learn to throw it too.  Soon enough everyone who can will be throwing that pitch and will be dominating with it.  It will have a huge impact on the game and I don't think it will be in a way that most people will enjoy.

Speaking of unhittable, that's also really why it should never be allowed even if only a couple guys really have that pitch down.

This is probably something that even the best pitchers would be taking a massive risk of throwing a lot of balls to try and tailor their strategy to it.

At the end of the day I'll be happy with robots umps if they are implemented properly and this aspect of the discussion should in theory play a small role in how that is done, I'm just hoping they dont need to shrink the zone or tweak it too much to avoid this scenario is all which is why I would be ok with it if it is very very difficult to do even though I agree that unhittable pitches being called strikes are generally against the nature of the game.",2019-11-04 12:57:19,1

> Not a fan,” Angels outfielder Brandon Marsh said. Just because the ball can barely clip the zone—top, bottom, inside, outside—and the catcher can have his wrist break and drop the ball and it’s still a strike.

Yea, that's correct.  Any part of the strike zone.

> I mean, I can’t complain against it, because it’s the ‘perfect’ strike zone, but baseball has always had human error in it, good and bad.

I wonder if we should protect bad players too.  Yea, he's old and he sucks now, but *he's always been part of the game, so we have to keep playing him....*

> With that in mind, a pitch gets called a strike when “any part of the ball passes through any part of the strike zone.”

> That last part is the key. If a small piece of the baseball passes through a small piece of the strike zone, that’s a “rulebook” strike.

I like how rulebook is in quotes, as though, as though journalist Josh Norris questions its legitimacy.

Yes, deliberately tricking the Umpire into making a bad call is something baseball needs *more* of.

It communicated something different than if it weren't   In studying the underlying ideas behind law, this same thing comes up. Blackletter rules differ from what everyone does. Which should be enforced? The answer ends up depending. For example, if there's a contract, whatever is on paper counts, because everyone had a chance to hammer that agreement out ahead of time. But when you break the terms of a software EULA, the agreement isn't likely to be enforced as written", even if you clicked a checkbox saying you agreed.

When things have always been done a certain way, it's legitimate to call that a *rule* that people follow.,2019-11-04 12:57:19,4

f6k8hh0,Automated Strike Zone Whiffs At Arizona Fall League,baseball,McKingford,"The biggest problem with catcher framing is that it's entirely one sided.

A batter doesn't, and generally can't, know where the catcher is positioned. All a hitter can do is assess the approaching pitch in terms of what he knows to be the strike zone. If it's outside he doesn't swing, if it's over the plate it's incumbent on him to swing. 

When you import catcher framing into the equation, you're adding something entirely outside the batter's control. He has no way of knowing what is going to happen to a pitch once he lets it pass - so no way of knowing where and how the catcher is going to receive it. And this works both ways: he has no way of knowing that the pitch he let go right down the middle of the plate for what should be an obvious strike was the result of a crossup, so that the umpire is fooled into calling it a ball; and he has no way of knowing that the pitch he knows full well is 3 inches wide of the plate is going to be called a strike because that's where the catcher is positioned and that he's going to flick it back into the strike zone.

Catcher framing is a one way street which freezes out the hitter, who cannot make corresponding adjustments.",2019-11-04 12:57:19,1

I’m tired of watching any team, not just the Yankees, get fucked over with inconsistent zones that change from inning to inning. Seriously, a strike to one pitcher in the top of the 3rd is a ball to the other pitcher in the bottom of the 3rd. A lot of fans don’t realize just how each pitch affects the next in an at bat. Judge strikes out as much as he does, partially because he’s a big swinger, but also because he gets fucked so much on those low strikes that pitchers can just go low and away with a slider and Judge will wave over it because half the time, it’s called anyway 

I’m tired of the “UmpShow”. I want to watch baseball, not some fat shit old fuck like Joe West throw around his weight behind the plate because he can. Case in point, that one ump(forget his name) that didn’t call an obvious strike because the catcher got up before the ump made the call.

In this YouTube shorts video, in the 3rd pitch thrown (by the Texas Ranger's pitcher), the Superimposed Strike Zone on the screen says the ball was off by a foot, even though the umpire calls it a strike.

Now I understand the Automated Strike Zone (ASZ) officially implemented is different to what we the audience see on the TV, but the ASZ is a strike-zone on a 2-D plane. This will make the eephus extremely hard to throw as a strike.

Having umps call whatever they want as a strike can have huge impacts on the game. The strike zone is a clearly defined area in the rulebook, and does not actually changed based on umpire, weather, ballpark, etc. The only difference in the zone should be a on a per batter basis based on their height / batting stance.

 If you have an accurate and consistent zone, then hitters can focus more on the pitches being thrown and less on what Angel Hernandez's zone is today after eating a tuna melt at the diner next to the ballpark.

Ultimately they decided that regular baseball really defines the strike zone as the very front of the plate, not the back part of it. So now backdoor pitches that tail in that might have been called strikes, aren't. 

They went too far one way, now too far the other (according to the author at least). I'm sure there'll be lots of tweaking on exactly how much 3D space the called strike zone should be.",2021-10-20 19:17:22,6

e4bdp95,What do you feel would be the consequences of an automated strike zone?,baseball,khaleesi_sarahae,"I believe that an AI Automated Strike Zone would be beneficial to Baseball as a whole. the strike zone is *objectively defined*, why do we treat it as subjective? All players would benefit because they will go into the game knowing exactly where the strike zone is and knowing it will be the same the whole game. Pitchers wouldn't have to take the first two innings to feel out the zone. Hitters won't have to guess whether or not the ump will be calling that pitch that's high and inside a ball. If my understanding is correct, AI can be trained to accurately make borderline calls like a real ump would. It would make it so the umps have way less influence over the course of the game (I want to watch the players not the umps). If my assessment is correct, it is possible to do implement an AI ump with todays technology.   The general objections to it is because of catcher framing and it would take away the human element. Taking away the *human element* is not a good argument either. Do you enjoy watching umps make the wrong calls? Watching the ump single-handedly change the course of the game? I personally watch baseball to be entertained by the players", not to be pissed off by the umps having a shitty zone. Also there will still be an ump behind the plate to call plays at home and relay the automated zones calls, so that angle of the argument is irrelevant. Catcher framing is the only semi-legitimate argument. The rebuttal to this though is the strike zone is defined as over home plate, therefore it is either a ball or a strike before it reaches the catcher and the catcher should not be able to influence that (if the strike zone is the one defined in the rule book). A good catcher should also have other skills such as calling the game, being a good at catching and throwing the ball and blocking wild pitches. So even if you like pitch framing, I think its worth losing pitch framing for an accurate zone. Now lets to your two other specific arguments. 

>Breaking pitches that are caught below the strike zone, but curved through the bottom of the zone, will be called strikes, where they are typically not now'

 As I said the zone is defined over the plate so it shouldn't matter where the ball is caught (the fact that it does now is a reflection of human error). The Automatic Zone will look actually in the strike zone and not where the ball was caught rendering this argument irrelevant. 

>The strike zone, as defined, would result in far more high strike calls, where typically a pitch at the letters is a ball now

Once again lets look to the definition of a strike zone in the rule book: *The STRIKE ZONE is that area over home plate the upper limit of which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow beneath the kneecap. The Strike Zone shall be determined from the batter’s stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball.* The automatic zone would follow this definition and would generate the strike zone for each player (if implemented properly), possibly it could be redefined for each pitch to account for adjustments in the batters stance but that is just details. Therefore this argument is also made irrelevant if the system is properly implemented, unless your objection is to the zone actually being called properly. 

Anyways sorry I rambled on for a bit, I hope this addresses your concerns.

e4bo7eh,What do you feel would be the consequences of an automated strike zone?,baseball,killyridols,I think automated strike zones could lead to a sort of meta game where players change their batting stance / posture to create a more favorable strike zone for themselves or otherwise manipulate the computer algorithm. At the very least the boundaries of where the box is drawn would become massively controversial in a way they aren't now.  As much as supporters of robot umpires believe the strike zone to be something objective (because the box they see on TV!), an automated strike zone would highlight how each player's unique strike zone must be defined in relationship to his body type/batting stance. This would always have to be a human judgment call on some level. I play way too much MLB The Show and it has made me acutely aware of how different it is hitting with a big bodied and relatively upright hitter like a Matt Adams or Rhys Hoskins vs a hitter with an old school hunched over stance ala Jeff Bagwell or Tony Gwynn. Perhaps hitters start hunching over in different counts to work the walk. Maybe there becomes a market for tiny players who can work a walk easily and make contact within their tiny automated strike zone. Human umpires who have been in the game their whole lives are really good at judging what is fair and what is cheap in this context. I imagine computers would have a harder time. 

I think the fact that most people aren't even aware of the negotiation human umpires do to settle on a fair strike zone for each individual hitter shows how good of a job they do of it, in general. The only time you ever hear about it is in the context of an outlier like Aaron Judge (see: https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/umpires-are-having-some-trouble-with-aaron-judge/). If you can't tell, I get a little triggered by childish arguments for robo umps, they would literally mess up the game in profound ways IMO.,2018-08-16 18:02:15,0
e4buv70,What do you feel would be the consequences of an automated strike zone?,baseball,khaleesi_sarahae,"How is this ‘meta game’ in any way different than pitch framing? And as you said, umps are good at adjusting their strike zones for the players (well some umps are), so tell me what would change?

The strike zone is objective. In the rule book it is defined as

>that area over home plate the upper limit of which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow beneath the kneecap. The Strike Zone shall be determined from the batter’s stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball.

That is an objective definition. It is treated as subjective by opponents of automatic strike zones because umps are human so the zone is defined by their estimation and definition of what it should be making it subjective. So no it’s not just ‘because the box we see on tv’. We have accepted 

Yeah, the difference in strike zone size per player exists now and will exist with an automatic strike zone. Your assertion that it will ‘create a market for tiny players who can walk easily’ makes no sense at all, if there’s little to no market for that now why would having a more accurate computerized strike zone change that? Once again you said umps are good at adjusting their strike zones for the players, so how would a computer make a big enough difference to make this a factor? Using AI will help make the system more malleable and humanlike (for all you crotchety people who like the ‘human element’) and will help the system particularly make calls at the edges. 

I’m sorry if this ‘triggers’ you but most of your arguments are nonsensical and irrelevant as an automatic strike zone would not have any of the effects that you seem so worried about. Before you get started I have a firm grip of how the strike zone changes per person and what an ump does to determine the strike zone. Generally umps do a great job but they are human and make mistakes and are variable (some more than others -looking at you Angel Hernandez). Why should we settle for this when we could have something better and give both hitters and pitchers the consistency most of them desire?",2018-08-16 18:02:15,1

As a fan, what I really care about is that baseball is entertaining; after all, that is why we watch it, correct? (I understand that a coach or a player - whose livelihood depends on the game - might feel differently). 

For me, instant replay has made the game less entertaining: I'll take an occasional missed call to the interminable delays, the *still* missed calls, and the endless view of whether someone really popped off the bag for a millisecond while the tag was being applied. The unintended negative consequences outweigh, for me, the positive that some calls (and only a few that really matter) will be correctly overturned. Instant replay is one of the reasons I stopped regularly watching the NFL a few years ago.

Likewise, an automated strike zone will have unintended consequences that we aren't considering right now - consequences that most likely will decrease the entertainment value of watching the game. And, personally, I find it entertaining to watch good catchers frame a pitch, and good hitters react to different umpire's strike zones.

Also, at the youth level I would really hate automated strike zones, even though umps at that level can be terrible. It's a good lesson in character building to teach your son or daughter to handle a bad call in a game. But of course that reason doesn't apply at the big leagues, except in the sense that innovations brought to the big leagues often eventually work their way down to the youth leagues.

The home plate ump can sit in a room operating the technology that's recording balls and strikes. Part of the human element is evolving and adapting to the times, making a mistake and correcting yourself accordingly.  The reasons you cited are bogus.   >We still can't count on the technology  We do for replay...  >It's because of speed  the strike would trigger an instant feedback.   >It's because, quite frankly, the strike zone is different for every single guy.  A computer is much better at adjusting a strike zone for a hitter than a guy standing behind to people in their way.  It's just so stupid to have a human ump behind the plate and it costs a lot of games because we're too stubborn to move into the future.

Some catchers would be out of a job.  Pitchers, without a doubt in the world, would rather have a catcher who can get them called strikes on borderline pitches rather than relying on a machine.  And I'm sure managers would like to protect their own, as well.  Hitters, of course, will be able to complain just as much about called strikes they thought were out of the zone as they do now.

ddg711j,When do you think we'll adopt an automated strike zone?,baseball,icyone,"It's only a part of the game because umpires are human. The rule book is pretty clear on what is and is not a strike:

The Strike Zone shall be determined from the batter's stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball.

Maybe in 2017 we're not at the point where we can 100% determine the strike zone with a computer, that's fair. But framing is taking advantage of a human judgment. Batters leaning backwards are taking advantage of a human judgment. Automated strike zones are impartial, and if you think that umpires should not be impartial, then we're fans of totally different sports.

I'm not convinced that it'll ever be 100% either, but I'm all for getting as close to 100% as possible.   I'm like the other guy here that spoke about Judge though. I've watched nearly every Yankees game since he came up, and while I won't hyperbolize and say that he routinely gets called out on strikes at the ankles, he is routinely given a zone that is much lower than it should be due to being huge and the umps having a comfort zone that doesn't fit his frame. I'm sure there are other examples around the game.   The truth is that many fans are going to hate umps and that they're given a lot more flack than they often deserve, but if the technology is there to improve the situation AT ALL, there is no reason not to implement it. It's not as if MLB can't afford it.   There's no reason why a game should be decided by the fact that the ump had a bad night, is dehydrated, if they got a new set of contacts yesterday, or whatever, if there's a way to avoid it. There's no reason why a 3-0 auto-strike or 0-2 suto-ball should be called, nor a make-up call when the ump clearly understood he blew the call on the previous pitch. Every blown call completely changes the make-up of an at-bat."

fcroiil,Automated Strike Zone Whiffs At Arizona Fall League,baseball,GeeseHateMe,"I think I can explain. [Let's use Trevor Kelley, who's average release is the farthest from the center of the plate, at 4.72 feet.](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=a84fe3ca-02fa-42cd-8527-bcfc36dc403f)  That video is from directly behind so you can see how that pitch is moving, and it's a slider.   So if we imagine he has a perfectly straight pitch with no break, and it's going to the outside corner on a right handed batter, that pitch is moving about 56.5 inches to the center of the plate, plus the extra 8.5 to the outside corner, so the total horizontal distance travelled over the course of the pitch is 65 inches.  His release point is about 6 feet in front of the mound, but to make math nicer, we'll say it's 5.5 feet.  So it's travelling 65 inches horizontally for every 55 feet towards the batter.  Home plate is 17 inches long, so this perfectly straight ball is now about 1.7 inches off the plate, so a little over half a ball's width.

Now if we account for break, even assuming the break is even along the path of the ball, the ball is now over two inches off the plate, when it had already barely clipped it in the first place.  The other thing you have to account for is the path of the ball has a higher horizontal component as it gets toward the plate.  I can't find an answer for how much horizontal movement increases over the course of a pitch.  I can also say that this effect is much more significant vertically.

Great points. I was referring to how the automated strike zone is supposedly set rather than the rule book definition of the strike zone. I agree with your points - I asked this question yesterday because you have guys who had hyper crouches, like Rickey Henderson had  back in the day.  If the hitter adopts a different hitting stance as the pitch is delivered - as in the excellent example of Griffey that you cited - because it's Wednesday, to counter a slump or there happens to be a knuckle ball pitcher on the mound, it creates some interesting challenges for technology. I was told that the technology currently builds a strike zone based upon the batting stance and prepared to hit position, but this is done in advance of the at-bat. Whether or not that is true, I don't know - it is just how I am told this works. For guys who the system hasn't seen prior to his at-bat, how does the technology work? Does someone literally make adjustments to the high/low points of the zone? 

I completely expect the wrinkle you mentioned to be put to the test and technology challenged by some enterprising hitter or manager. I will be interesting to see how baseball reacts.,2019-10-29 19:22:43,2

With Hawkeye coming in and Trackman going out, it'll be interesting to see how much more accurate the system gets as it is using computer vision vs doppler radar next year.

I'm leaning in favor of yes. 

Why am I asking this today? Well, the edge of the strike zone has been a source of controversy in almost every postseason game so far. (Yankees, Bucs, and Jays were unhappy with the calls). 

MLB has decided to pursue the principle of getting it right by using instant replay, and it has made the game better. The automated strike zone would be the next step in honor of this principle and would speed up the game, reduce arguments on the field, and make the strike zone exactly the same on every pitch for every team. If I remember correctly, Eric Byrnes of MLB Network said that the pitch tracking systems are accurate to about 1/10th of an inch, which is much better than a human umpire can do.

cvuag8v,Will MLB eventually go with an automated strike zone? Are you in favor or opposed to it?,baseball,Antithesys,> the fabric of the game  These discussions really boil down to what we define the game to be.

If the game of baseball is simply two teams of nine trying to beat each other, then something like a computerized strike zone is *not* part of the game. The umpire is not part of the game; he only exists to be a neutral arbiter of disputed plays. Now that technology has caught up to their caliber, umpires can conceivably be replaced.

But if the game is something that's been described as America's family heirloom, something traditional and romantic and intangible, then umpires have, over the course of 150 years, ingrained themselves indelibly into the fabric of baseball. I will happily argue that the first half of the 20th century, with all its legends and stars and pioneers, got half of its character from Bill Klem, the greatest umpire of them all (Son, when you throw a strike, Mr. Hornsby will let you know it). We boo and hiss and call for a robot revolution, but we also wait patiently when Blue has to walk off a foul tip to the tender regions, forgive Jim Joyce for his historic sin, and accept the social contract that the umpire determines what's what on the field.

I mean, just looking at the time in general, his first start was in 1890... come on, you want to revert the game back to a 50' pitching box, no gloves, no night games? This is ridiculous, the game changes with the times.

There are already dozens of caveats to comparisons across era's in baseball.

iecueo9,Rob Manfred Says MLB Will Likely Introduce Automated Strike Zone System in 2024,SFGiants,realparkingbrake,">  but they already do that for the humans all the time,

Not sure what you mean here.  The rulebook strike zone is not what most umps use, most umps don't call the high strikes that they should according to the rulebook.  But MLB hasn't altered the rulebook zone as a result, they let it stand on paper despite the umps not taking that zone as gospel.  As Mike Krukow has pointed out, if umps did call the rulebook zone there would be a lot of unhappy batters and fans due to way more strikeouts.

The generous margin of error in MLB's official umpire ball/strike grading system is a problem.  Many fans seem to think the Umpire Scorecard proves how bad some umps can be.  But the Umpire Scorecard has no official weight and nobody in baseball has to take it seriously (even though I bet they all look at it every day).  If the Umpire Scorecard matched the official rating system, we'd see a fat margin at the edges of the zone where the ump can call it a ball or a strike and MLB is okay with it either way.

There will be issues with the robo-umps, it might take a while to get everything dialed in.  They've had trouble getting it to work in the rain, don't know if that is fixed yet.  Security is also an issue, someone hacking into the system could make a lot of money in Vegas.  It's also a concern that pitchers and batters will have to adapt to the new zone.  Maybe that's a case of being careful what you wish for, because you might get it.",2022-06-30 02:43:12,2
iecy163,Rob Manfred Says MLB Will Likely Introduce Automated Strike Zone System in 2024,SFGiants,No_Bandicoot2306,"MLB *has* actually altered the official strike zone in the past --   In 1996, they dropped the official bottom from the top of the knees to the bottom of the knees. "

In 1988 they moved the official top from the armpit to the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the pants

In fact, they've redefined the official strikezone 13 times since the advent of baseball.

And semi-officially, they have moved it many, many more times through instruction to MLB umpires. The unofficial official strikezone you refer to above is not some nebulous idea the umps came to on their own, it was passed down from the commissioners office.

I've suggested that for some time, but on the basis of results rather than training.  Younger umps are consistently more accurate calling balls/strikes, so I think they should be behind the plate all the time while the older umps work the bases.  As they age, they would move to the bases and newer umps would work the plate.  A potential problem there is slow turnover among major league umpires, there usually isn't more than one opening a year.

Provided nobody loses his job or has his pay cut it might be something the MLBUA could agree to if the alternative is robots.  But even good ball/strike umps have bad games, as Pat Hoberg recently demonstrated.",2022-06-30 02:43:12,2
